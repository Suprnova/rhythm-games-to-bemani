Type a combination of numbers to select each game that you want to search for games in, then press Enter. This is so that you won't waste time searching for songs in games that you don't have access to. If you want to save a file that will contain all of the results for matches, you'll be asked here about it.

After it finishes requesting the BEMANIWiki pages, it will ask you what game you want to use as your search criteria. Afterwards, it will ask you for the directory to the Songs folder in the game you selected. Copy and paste your Songs directory into the console by right clicking on the window, then press Enter. (You can get more help finding your directory with [this link](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/osu!_Program_Files) for osu!, [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stepmania/stepmania/5_1-new/Docs/Userdocs/sm5_beginner.txt) on section 2.3.1 for Stepmania, and [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloneHero/comments/9gbcnc/how_do_we_add_songs/e62sjyr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for Clone Hero.)

Afterwards, you will receive a list of songs that were found in each of the games you selected. Refer to the file specified if you saved it, or copy the information and use it as reference when you need to. (For example, adding songs to your favourites from the eAmusement website or with the proprietary modular arcade server that is used at your local arcade.)
